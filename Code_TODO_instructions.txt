===== Instructions =====

[flipper_keyboard.cpp]
- set up the publishers 
- complete the code in the main while loop (ie. write the switch case)

[flipper_controller.cpp]
- set up the publishers and subscribers
- complete the code in the main loop for autonomous and manual mode 
	- can only publish the flipper command when the command is different from the current state of the flipper (look at the flipperCommandCallback() function in robot_controller.py to understand why)

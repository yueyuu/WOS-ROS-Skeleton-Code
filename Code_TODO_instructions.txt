===== Instructions =====

[flipper_keyboard.cpp]
- set up the publishers 
- complete the code in the main while loop (ie. write the switch case)

[flipper_controller.cpp]
- set up the publishers and subscribers
- complete the code in the main loop for autonomous and manual mode 
	- can only publish the flipper command when the command is different from the current state of the flipper (look at the flipperCommandCallback() function in robot_controller.py to understand why)
	
- for both code above will need to use the structs defined in the file
	
[robot_controller.py]
- located in ~/WOS-ROS-Skeleton-Code/wos24_rpi_ws/src/robot_controller
- lines 65 and 69: the 'min' and 'max' corresponds to the servo position
	- depending on how the flipper is fixed to the robot, these 2 lines of code need to change accordingly 
	- trial and error after mounting the flipper to determine which one it should be
